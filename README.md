## General info

### Simulator of gravitational interaction.

#### The program allows you to create objects that can represent astronomical object and see how they interact with each other in 2D space.


## Technologies

### Programming language: C

Used libraries: 
 <stdio.h>
 <math.h>
 <stdlib.h>
 <string.h>
 <SDL.h>

## Setup

#### Program needs confing file that consits:

### Simulation setting:
* time step
* amount of objects
* duration
* orbit draw on/off
* array of objects

### Every object has to be described with given values:
* name
* position X
* position Y
* velocity X
* velocity Y
* mass
* radius
* color in rgba

When simulation is finished program returns result file.

Both config and example result file can be found in the repo.




## Project status: finished
